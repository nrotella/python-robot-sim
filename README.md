This is an initial README file for the python-robot-sim project.  I'll be using this project to gradually build up an articulated robot simulator in python using Qt and OpenGL for GUI and graphical elements, respectively.

I will document the development as part of my personal blog, with each blog post being linked to a specific commit for easy access to the code I'm writing about.

For now, this repository contains only a simple PyQt + PyOpenGL application intended to get started using these tools.  You can read the post [here](https://nrotella.github.io/journal/first-steps-python-qt-opengl.html){:target="blank_"}.

As always, feel free to [email me](mailto:nicholas.rotella@gmail.com){:target="blank_"} if you have any questions of comments.  You can also use the Disqus section at the bottom of a blog post for this purpose.
