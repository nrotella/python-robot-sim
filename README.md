This is an initial README file for the python-robot-sim project.  I'll be using this project to gradually build up an articulated robot simulator in python using Qt and OpenGL for GUI and graphical elements, respectively.

I will document the development as part of my personal blog, with each blog post being linked to a specific commit for easy access to the code I'm writing about as detailed below:

1. [First Steps with python + Qt + OpenGL](https://nrotella.github.io/journal/first-steps-python-qt-opengl.html): Creates a simple Qt and OpenGL application to render and manipulate a cube.
2. [Initial Simulator Graphics in OpenGL](https://nrotella.github.io/journal/initial-simulator-graphics-opengl.html): Extends the previous application to render basic simulator graphics and adds a user-controlled camera.
3. [3D Geometry for Robotics](https://nrotella.github.io/journal/3d-geometry-robotics.html): Introduces theory for representing object pose and a python module for basic 3d geometry.

As always, feel free to [email me](mailto:nicholas.rotella@gmail.com) if you have any questions of comments.  You can also use the Disqus section at the bottom of a blog post for this purpose.
